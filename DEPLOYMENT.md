# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Project Ready for Deployment âœ…

Your portfolio project has been configured and is ready for Vercel deployment.

## Changes Made:

1. **Fixed Vite Configuration**: Updated `base` path from GitHub-specific path to root path (`/`)
2. **Added Node.js Version**: Specified Node.js version requirement (>=18.0.0) in package.json
3. **Created .vercelignore**: Added file to exclude unnecessary files from deployment
4. **Fixed React Version**: Downgraded from React 19 to React 18.3.1 for better stability
5. **Enhanced Vercel Config**: Added explicit build settings and asset caching headers
6. **Verified Build Process**: Confirmed the build works correctly

## Deployment Steps:

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from your project directory
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Yes
# - Which scope? (your account)
# - Link to existing project? No
# - Project name: daksh-portfolio (or your preferred name)
# - Directory: ./
```

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your repository
5. Vercel will auto-detect it's a Vite project
6. Click "Deploy"

## Build Configuration:
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

## Performance Notes:
- The `astronaut.png` file is ~4MB. Consider optimizing it for better loading times
- All other assets are reasonably sized
- Build output is optimized and compressed

## Troubleshooting:
If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure your repository is public or you have proper access
2. Check that all dependencies are in package.json
3. Verify the build works locally with `npm run build`
4. Check Vercel deployment logs for specific error messages
5. If you see a blank white screen, check browser console for JavaScript errors
6. Ensure React version compatibility (now using React 18.3.1)

## Key Fixes Applied:
- **React Version**: Downgraded from React 19 to React 18.3.1 (React 19 is very new and may have compatibility issues)
- **Base Path**: Fixed from GitHub path to root path for Vercel
- **Build Configuration**: Added explicit build settings in vercel.json
- **Asset Optimization**: Added proper caching headers for static assets

Your project should now deploy successfully to Vercel! ðŸš€
